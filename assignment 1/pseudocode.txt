Procedure AncestralSampling(nrSamples, bayesianNetwork)
Input: nrSamples the number of samples that have to be obtained
       bayesianNetwork = {x1, x2,...xn} the nodes of the bayesianNetwork 
       ordered so there is no link to a previous node
1 initialize array Samples with size nrSamples
2 for k = 1 to nrSamples
3         generate n random numbers and store them into array Randoms
4         for each xi from bayesianNetwork
5             Probability = SigmoidFunction([s1,s2,...sample values from parent nodes of xi])
6             if Randoms(i) < Probability
7                 store sample 0 at Samples(k,i)
8             else store sample 1 at Samples(k,i)
9 calculate desired marginal probabilities using Samples
